## Zero-Conf Transactions and Full-RBF

### Background
With Bitcoin Core 29.0, [full-RBF is now enabled by default](https://atlas21.com/bitcoin-core-29-0-full-rbf-default-network-improvements/) and the `mempoolfullrbf` setting has been removed. Any transaction in the mempool can now be replaced regardless of BIP125 signaling, fundamentally changing the security model for zero-confirmation transaction acceptance.

### Malicious Risks
* Double-spend attacks now trivial for any user with RBF-capable wallet
* [Research shows wallets without RBF checks amplify retail double-spend risk](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401223001081)

### Non-Malicious Risks
* **User Experience Issues**: Protocol-unaware users may not understand that unconfirmed funds aren't actually "theirs yet," leading to accidental double-spends when trying to "speed up" transactions
* **Security Model Breakdown**: Zero-conf risk analysis changes from "susceptible to miner attacks" to "anyone can attack with easy-to-use wallet interfaces"
* **Network Fragmentation**: As full-RBF adoption spread, previously reliable zero-conf acceptance policies became unpredictably unreliable
